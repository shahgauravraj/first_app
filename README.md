# FIRST_APP

This is my first ever Flutter project for learning basics of mobile app development using flutter and Dart.

## What's this app?

This is a very basic Quiz App build using flutter and dart having a very simple UI without many widgets. After you run this app, there are a bunch of questions that are displayed, one after another, each one having four options to choose from and once you make a choice, next question appears. When you're done, based on your performance, a score is displayed immediately.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for me to learn mobile app development using Dart and Flutter. Here, I am following an online tutorials series on Udemy to learn Flutter.

A few resources to get started with basic Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
